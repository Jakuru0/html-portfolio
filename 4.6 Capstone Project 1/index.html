        <h3>PERSONAL PROFILE</h3>
        <p style="width:800px;">I am a currently studying Korean Language at PNU LEI while on a working holiday in Korea, during the 3 semesters that I have been here, I received a scholarship for excellent performance twice. In the UK I was an employee of BT PLC working in the field of network design with a focus on security. In addition to this, I also coached badminton at The University of Suffolk in my free time. My time at BT allowed me to engage with a formal structured office environment which has been greatly beneficial to both work and my wider life. Prior to working for BT I studied a PGDip in Embedded Digital Systems and an MPhys in Theoretical Physics, both from The University of Sussex. These courses have provided me with excellent analytical and problem-solving skills, while my part-time role as a supervisor at Wm Morrison Supermarkets PLC has taught me the importance of great customer service and effective leadership. Alongside studying and working, I also competed in badminton and cricket, eventually captaining the badminton team, I believe this shows my nature to work hard and determination to be the best that I can be. My hobbies include researching new technologies and I enjoy using these wherever possible.</p>
